## Using Github with R
**Aims of this section:**   
1) To introduce the concept of vesrion control and to name some version control software and to focus on one (git).  
2) To widen your knowledge about Github ie. what it is and why you should be using it.  
3) How do we integrate the use of Git into Rstudio.

**Version Control - we have a problem**   
Anyone who has editted anything other than a trivial document (think a thesis here) or a collaborative document (think a paper here) will have experienced the problem of having to revert to an earlier version of the manuscript e.g. upon discovering a mistake.   
Many ways have been evolved involving convoluted naming and numbering schemes that necessitate human involvement and knowledge to operate e.g. *Finaldoc4.5_final.Doc*.  
<ins> Enter version control </ins>.  
The above scenarios are commonly encountered in software development and consequently systems have been put into place to allow consistent transition between versions of documents.

* What is git? What is version control?
* What is Github?
* Okay, how does using git help me?
- Creating some R code in Rstudio and publishing it to Github
- Getting comments/wishes/bug reports from users (Issues)
- Fixing code and re-publishing
