1. Create ssh-key (under Rstudio Preferences).

3. Create a .R or .Rmd file to work on. You can download/upload or cut and paste the Example.Rmd from the 'git_in_R' repository or create your own.   
Save your file in Rstudio and then go to the Tools menu and select the version control - 'commit' option to bring up the Rstudio git interface (You may be asked for a password - this should be the password for the computer you are on).

4. Use the git interface within Rstudio to commit and display changes.  
Click the checkbox next to your file (Note that added material is displayed below in green and deleted material in red).   
Enter a comment in the commit box and press 'commit' button. This could be done for several files but we are only doing one so now having commited we move onto the step that pushed the committed files to our GH repo.   
This is the button maked 'push' with an up arrow. You should now get a dialogue showing the progress of pushing the file.

Try adding and deleting lines and using the commit/push combo to confirm that Rstudios git interface will display and log changes in a similar fashion to the web one we used in Exercise 1.
